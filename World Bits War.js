/*
Variation of this nice kata, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).

A number's strength is determined by the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. Negative integers work against their own side so their strength is negative. For example -5 = -101 has strength -2 and +5 = +101 has strength +2.

The side with the largest cumulated strength wins.

Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.

Examples:

bitsWar([1,5,12]) => "odds win" //1+101 vs 1100, 3 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,20]) => "evens win" //111-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,-2,6]) => "tie" //111-11 vs -1+110, 3-2 vs -1+2

  let evenArr = []
